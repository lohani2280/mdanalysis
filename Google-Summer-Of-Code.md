# How to Contact MDAnalysis

You are more than welcome to contact us before submitting your application, we will be happy to advise you on most aspects of the process. Getting in touch first is especially recommended if you are planning to apply to work on an original idea, rather than one of our suggestions.

So if you want to introduce yourself, discuss ideas or your application feel free to write a mail to either the [Discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/mdnalysis-discussion) mailing list or the [Development](http://groups.google.com/group/mdnalysis-devel) mailing list.

# Project Ideas 2016

A list of projects ideas. Each with a short sentence describing it. If more information/background is needed create a new page

- Implement a [General Dimension Reduction Algorithm](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/%5BGSoC-Project%5D-Dimension-Reduction)
- Expand the reach of MDAnalysis by implementing a new file format, such as the [TNG file format](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.23495/abstract) from Gromacs
- Increase the availability of this code by helping port MDAnalysis to Python 3 and Windows. See [#260](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues/260)
- Experiment with [Dask](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/) as a backend for your Trajectory classes.
- Help us implement a general pipeline to use multiple CPU-cores for analysis tasks ([Dask](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/), [MPI](http://pythonhosted.org/mpi4py/usrman/index.html))
- Work with domain-decomposition algorithms to improve our distance search algorithms ([cell grids](https://github.com/richardjgowers/cellgrid)).
- Implement a flexible parser for atom selections.
- Implement flexible search of atoms inside volume elements defined by densities. 
- Or your idea here! Get in contact with us to propose an idea.


# What will your summer be like

The MDAnalysis development team is friendly, cooperative and relatively informal. We consist of people from a wide range of backgrounds, including students, PhD-candidates, professors and researchers actively using this software.
We will take your work with respect and appreciate the time that you will spend on MDAnalysis since it will help us in both our own and our community's research projects.

# Am I experienced enough?

The answer is generally: **Yes**. The MDAnalysis Summer of Code team values creativity, intelligence and enthusiasm above specific knowledge of the libraries or algorithms we use. We think that an interested and motivated student who is willing to learn is more valuable than anything else.
The range of available projects should suit people with different backgrounds, both with and without prior experience of computational chemistry.

We also value general software design or development experience above specific library or API knowledge. It is absolutely OK if you have never worked with python before. Just make sure to let us know in your application.

At the same time if you have experience with our tools (such as Python or Cython) or other molecular tools make sure to let us know about that as well.

# Our Expectations from Students

**Communication**

- Write a short report for us once a week
- Commit early and commit often! Push to github so that we can see and review your work.
- Actively work on our project timeline and communicate with us during the community bonding period
- Communicate every working day with your mentor. Just say "Hello" if you like. It can be via email, skype, github comments, etc
- If there is a reason why you can't work or can't contact us on a regular basis please make us aware of this.
- If you don't communicate with us regularly we will fail you.

**Midterm and Final evaluations**

- Set a realistic goal for mid-term. If you fail to meet your own goal we are more likely to fail you in the evaluations
- Have some code merged into our develop branch at the end of the summer to pass the final evaluation
- The last point is a hard requirement. Make sure that your time plan includes it.
