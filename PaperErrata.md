The paper on MDAnalysis was published as

  * N. Michaud-Agrawal, E. J. Denning, T. B. Woolf, and O. Beckstein. MDAnalysis: A Toolkit for the Analysis of Molecular Dynamics Simulations. _J. Comput. Chem._ **32** (2011), 2319â€“2327, DOI: [10.1002/jcc.21787](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcc.21787)

The [HTML version of the paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.21787/full) has so many indentation errors in the code example to make it almost completely useless for learning MDAnalysis. The [PDF](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.21787/pdf) version is mostly correct although the final formatted version ended up with a few line breaks that are illegal in the Python syntax. The free PubmedCentral version (available April 2012, e.g. through [PMID 21500218](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21500218)), however, contains perfectly formatted Python code.
