# How to Contact MDAnalysis

You are mote then welcome to contact us before submitting your application, we will be happy to advise your on most aspects of the process. Getting in touch first is especially recommended if you are planning to apply to work on an original idea, rather than one of our suggestions.

So if you want to introduce yourself, discuss ideas or your application feel free to write a mail to either the [mdnalysis-discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/mdnalysis-discussion) mailing list or the [mdnalysis-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/mdnalysis-devel) mailing list.

# Project Ideas 2016

A list of projects ideas. Each with a short sentence describing it. If more information/background is needed 
create a new page

- Implement Principle Component Analysis, Time Independent Correlation Analysis, Diffusion Maps or another dimension reduction technique of your choice
- implement the TNG file format from Gromacs
- Port MDAnalysis to python 3
- Experiment with Dask as a backend for your Trajectory classes.
- Help us implement a general pipeline to use multiple CPU-cores for analysis tasks (dask, MPI)
- Improve our distance algorithms (cell grids, domain decomposition)

# What will your summer be like

The MDAnalysis development team is cooperative and relatively informal. We mostly consist of students and PhD-candidates. We will take your work very serious and appreciate the time that you will spend on MDAnalysis since it will help us in our own research projects.

# Am I experienced enough

The answer is generally: **Yes**. The MDAnalysis Summer of Code team values intelligence and enthusiasm above specific knowledge of the libraries or algorithms we use. We think that an interested and motivated student who is willing to learn is more valuable than anything else.

We also value general software design or development experience above specific library or API knowledge. It is absolutely OK if you have never worked with python before. Just make sure to let us know in your application.

At the same time if you have experience with our tools (python. cython) or other molekular tools make sure to let us know about that as well.

# Our Expectations from Students

**Communication**

- write us at least once a week a short report
- commit early and commit often. And push to github so that we can see your work.
- actively work on our project timeline and communicate with us during the community bonding period
- Communicate every working day with your mentor. Just say "Hello" if you like. It can be via email, skype, github comments, etc
- if there is a reason, why you can't work or can't contact us on a regular bases please announce them early.
- if you don't communicate with us regularly we will fail you.

**Midterm and Final evaluations**

- set a realistic goal for mid-term. If you fail to meet your own goal we are more likely to fail you in the evaluations
- have some code merged into our develop branch at the end of the summer to pass the final evaluation
- the last point is a hard requirement. Make sure that your timeplan includes it.
