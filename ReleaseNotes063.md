  * 0.6.3 release
  * minimum requirement is <strike>python 2.4</strike> python 2.5 (using with\_statement in the analysis module and we have not tested on 2.3 in a while)

  * analysis modules (MDAnalysis.analysis):
    * lipid bilayer leaflet detection
    * native contact analysis ("q1-q2")
    * rms-fitting based on sequence alignment
  * write selections for other codes from AtomGroups (VMD, pymol, CHARMM,  Gromacs ndx)
  * gro reader ([Issue 31](https://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/issues/detail?id=31))
  * better API for loading a topology and a coordinate file in Universe()
  * trajectory reader: DCDReader can reverse trajectory with negative step increment; XTC/TRRReader can do simple (forward) slices by doing (slow!) sequential iteration
  * deprecated principleAxes() and introduced principalAxes() with less confusing return values ([Issue 33](https://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/issues/detail?id=33)).
  * fixed wrong unitcell dimensions for XTC/TRR ([Issue 34](https://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/issues/detail?id=34))
  * added basic XYZ reader with compression support ([Issue 35](https://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/issues/detail?id=35))
