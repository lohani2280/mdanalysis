Release 0.11.0 is a major update for MDAnalysis. It contains a number of *backwards-incompatible API changes*, i.e. **existing code is likely to break**. Additionally, some old functionality has been deprecated and will be removed for the 1.0.0 release.

The [MDAnalysis 0.11 unifying release user guide](MDAnalysis-0.11-unifying-release-user-guide) should help you with porting your code. We are also making a script `ten2eleven.py` available that automates some of the API changes in your existing code, as described in [Migrating MDAnalysis code with ten2eleven](Migrating-MDAnalysis-code-with-ten2eleven.py).

The full release notes on this page to be written when release 0.11.0 is final. For right now see the [CHANGELOG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/develop/package/CHANGELOG) on the develop branch.
