[MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) is a free package management system for Mac OX X. It brings all the open GNU software and much more to Mac OS X and makes the machine actually useful for scientific work.

Installation is relatively straightforward by following the [MacPorts Installation Instructions](http://www.macports.org/install.php).

An alternative is the [Fink](http://www.finkproject.org/) package management system.
