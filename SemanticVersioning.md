[Semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) is a set of rules to number releases in a meaningful and consistent manner. The idea is that a user can immediately see from the release number how severe changes are between releases.

## Summary of rules ##
The [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) page contains the rules that we follow. In brief:

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

  1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  1. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
  1. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

## MDAnalysis and Semantic Versioning ##
A brief summary for what this means for MDAnalysis is given under
**[Release Policy and Release Numbering](PreparingReleases#Release_policy_and_release_numbering)**.
