##Introduction
Software testing is extremely important to the MDAnalysis project, so that users of the package can be confident in the results of their analysis. With the current test package [nose, ceasing to be developed](http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#note-to-users) we have decided to move to using [py.test](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/).

## How?

* Existing Plugins and how to import them
* Tests passing with pytests
* Tests failing currently
* Examples of failed tests
* Where can we replace nose with pytests.
