**[MDAnalysis](http://www.mdanalysis.org)** is an object-oriented python toolkit to analyze molecular dynamics trajectories generated by [CHARMM](http://www.charmm.org/), [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org), [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/), [LAMMPS](http://lammps.sandia.gov/), or [Amber](http://ambermd.org/).

**MDAnalysis** allows one to read molecular dynamics trajectories and access the atomic coordinates through [numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org/) arrays. This provides a flexible and relatively fast framework for complex analysis tasks. In addition, [CHARMM-style](http://www.charmm.org/html/documentation/c34b1/select.html) atom [selection commands](https://pythonhosted.org/MDAnalysis/documentation_pages/selections.html#selection-commands) are implemented. Trajectories can also be manipulated (for instance, fit to a reference structure) and written out.

A typical usage pattern is to iterate through a trajectory and analyze coordinates for every frame. In the following [example](Examples) the end-to-end distance of a protein and the radius of gyration of the backbone atoms are calculated:

```python
import MDAnalysis
from MDAnalysis.tests.datafiles import PSF,DCD   # test trajectory
import numpy.linalg
u = MDAnalysis.Universe(PSF,DCD)                 # always start with a Universe
nterm = u.s4AKE.N[0]   # can access structure via segid (s4AKE) and atom name
cterm = u.s4AKE.C[-1]  # ... takes the last atom named 'C'
bb = u.select_atoms('protein and backbone')  # a selection (a AtomGroup)
for ts in u.trajectory:     # iterate through all frames
  r = cterm.pos - nterm.pos # end-to-end vector from atom positions
  d = numpy.linalg.norm(r)  # end-to-end distance
  rgyr = bb.radius_of_gyration()  # method of a AtomGroup; updates with each frame
  print "frame = {}: d = {} Angstroem, Rgyr = {} Angstroem".format(ts.frame, d, rgyr)
```

## Availability and Installing ##

See [Installation Quick Start](http://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/installation_quick_start/).

## Learning MDAnalysis ##

The [MDAnalysis Tutorial](http://www.mdanalysis.org/MDAnalysisTutorial/) serves as an introduction to the library and there are other [Tutorials](Tutorials) available, too.

See the **[Online Documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/MDAnalysis/index.html)** for more information on how to use MDAnalysis and the [TableOfContents](TableOfContents) for a general overview of the available documentation on the Wiki. The [paper on MDAnalysis](#Citation) contains a high-level description of the structure and philosophy of the library together with examples of its use.

MDAnalysis also comes with [example scripts](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/tree/master/package/examples) and fairly general [analysis modules](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/tree/master/package/MDAnalysis/analysis), available as [MDAnalysis.analysis](https://pythonhosted.org/MDAnalysis/documentation_pages/analysis_modules.html) â€” you can use this code as a starting point for your own analysis scripts.

Finally, you can also ask for advice or help on the [mdnalysis-discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/mdnalysis-discussion) mailing list. If you find **bugs** or want to **request enhancements** please [file a report](ReportingProblems) in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues).

## Historical, Technical and Artistic Remarks ##

MDAnalysis was originally inspired by the Schulten Group's [MDTools](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/MDTools/) for Python, and the DCD reading code is derived from VMD's [catdcd](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/MDTools/catdcd/). MDAnalysis is GPL licensed, except for some 3rd party code that is included under GPL-compatible licenses; for instance the dcd reading code is under the [UIUC Open Source Licence](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/MDTools/catdcd/license.html). See the files [AUTHORS](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/blob/master/package/AUTHORS) and [LICENSE](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/blob/master/package/LICENSE) in the distribution for details.

Some time-critical routines are written in C or [cython](http://cython.org) and require a working C compiler. The minimum required version of Python is 2.7. MDAnalysis has been successfully used on Linux and Mac OS X.
